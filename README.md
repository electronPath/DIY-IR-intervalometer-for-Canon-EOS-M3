This device send an IR signal for a Canon camera and can be used as a remote and intervalometer. Should work with Canon cameras that have an IR receiver.
Or you can replace LED with a transistor and adapt the device and program to work with cameras that accept a stereo (3 pole) 2.5 mm jack plug.
Also, you can adapt the program to work with Nikon cameras too! Here is a link to a tutorial from adafruit. (I don't have a Nikon camera to test it ...)
